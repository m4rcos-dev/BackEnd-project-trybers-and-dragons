<p>Project developed during the back-end module of the Trybe full-stack web development course.</p>
<p>Project used to apply the principles of the SOLID architecture and the principles of POO in a structure of role-playing games, better known as RPG games (Role Playing Game)</p>
<p>Each class and interface was developed using the context below, respecting the attributes of each race and character and the logic of what each one can do on the battlefield using their methods.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>üî® Context</h2>
<p>In the universe of Trybers and Dragons - T&D, almost all beings that walk these lands belong to a defined race.</p>
<p>The various races (such as, for example, Elvish, Orc or Dwarf) define the characteristics of the characters within the game since its creation, such as their life points and their dexterity. However, there are bestial beings called monsters that do not have a specific race, but can fight.</p>
<p>Some beings also have an energy and, when training the use of energy, they come to have an archetype. In general, archetypes define a character's vocation, skills and worldview: how they face situations, explore dungeons or face monsters. As examples of archetypes present in T&D, we can mention warrior, mage and necromancer.</p>
<p>Most of the beings can be considered fighters, just to have some specific attributes. On many occasions, fights can occur between different characters, as well as between characters and monsters.</p>

**Now, follow the blind the dungeon master!**

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running application
</br>
<details>
   <summary><strong>üêã Running on Docker or Locally</strong></summary><br />

   ## With Docker

   > Run the `node` service with the command `docker-compose up -d`.
   - This service will start a container called `trybers_and_dragons`.
   - From here you can run the `trybers_and_dragons` container via CLI or open it in VS Code.

   > Use the `docker exec -it trybers_and_dragons bash` command.
   - It will give you access to the interactive terminal of the container created by compose, which is running in the background.

   > Install dependencies [**If any**] with `npm install`

   ‚ö† Attention ‚ö† If you choose to use Docker, **ALL** the commands available in `package.json` (npm start, npm test, npm run dev, ...) must be executed **INSIDE** the container, that is, in the terminal that appears after executing the `docker exec` command mentioned above.

   ‚ö† Warning ‚ö† Do not run the npm audit fix command! It updates several project dependencies, and this update causes conflicts with the evaluator.


‚ú® **Tip:** The `Remote - Containers` extension (which will be in the recommended extensions section of VS Code) is indicated so that you can develop your application in the Docker container directly in VS Code, as you do with your local files .

   ## Without Docker

   > Install dependencies [**If any**] with `npm install`

   ‚ö† Warning ‚ö† Do not run the npm audit fix command! It updates several project dependencies, and this update causes conflicts with the evaluator.

   ‚ú® **Tip:** To run the project this way, you must have `node` installed on your computer.

   ‚ú® **Tip:** The evaluator expects that the `node` version used is 16.
